<h1>About</h1>
The "Crisismap" application provides users with aggregated information around crisis. We integrate news from media and data from sensors like Earth observation and meteo models.
We consider it’s important to know what is going on around you and nearby, regarding crisis situations and media’s attention to the particular cases.
